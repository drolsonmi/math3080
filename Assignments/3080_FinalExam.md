The final exam will consist of two portions: (1) Some questions based on material learned in class, and (2) a data analysis of some data.

# Portion 1: Written Exam
The written portion of the exam will open at the beginning of the two-hour period set aside for our final exam and will be due 24 hours later. See the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/drolsonmi/math3080/blob/main/3080_Schedule_Sp23.md) to see the exact time the final opens.Â 

# Portion 2: Data Science Project
We have learned a lot about data analysis this semester. This portion of the final exam will give you the opportunity to apply these skills. You get to choose the dataset. Here are some great data sources:
* Kaggle
* DataCamp
* Data you have previously obtained (don't remake a project from another class)

Choose a dataset you are interested in exploring. Then create graphs to learn more about the data. When making graphs, consider the variable types and choose graphs that effectively describe those variables (for example, a scatterplot doesn't usually show categorical data very well).

Once you choose your data, do a data analysis using these techniques we learned:
1. Obtaining Data
2. Missing Data
3. Data Wrangling
4. Graphing
    * Make at least your final graph an interactive graph

When completed, __create a presentation of what you found__. You can do this as a video or as a paper. (If you want to do a video presentation, you have free access to Microsoft Teams. I can help you with this - come talk to me so I can help.) The presentation should include:
* A sample of the original data (along with a description of where the data was obtained)
* Some of the challenges with the data (Was there missing data? How did you wrangle the data?)
* Show the figures and explain what certain features of the graphs tell us
* Make some conclusions from your analysis, and describe where you could go in the future (another analysis, create a model, ...)
