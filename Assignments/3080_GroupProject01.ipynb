    "You have received a dataset that shows the GDP of countries around the world. Your employer has asked you to create a linear regression model to predict a nation's GDP based on its population, population density, literacy, birthrate, and deathrate.\n",

    "Your first guess is that GDP is affected by population. So, start by finding the correlation between population and GDP. Then we'll expland to considering other variables.\n",

    "3. Linear Regression of Population and GDP\n",

    "    * Calculate the line of best fit\n",

    "    * Which variable from the data has the largest weight in the prediction? Would it be positively or negatively correlated\n",
