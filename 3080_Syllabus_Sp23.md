## Course Description
This course will include introduction to data analysis tools in Python, descriptive statistics, data structures with Numpy & Pandas, introductory hypothesis testing & statistical inference, web scraping and data acquisition via APIs, generalized linear regression, classification methods including logistic regression; k-nearest neighbors; decision trees; support vector machines; and neural networks, data visualization, clustering methods, dimensionality reduction; including principle component analysis; network analysis; rating, ranking, and elections, cleaning and reformatting messy datasets using regular expression or dedicated tools such as open refine; natural language processing; ethics of big data. 

This course supports an inclusive learning environment where diverse perspectives are recognized, respected and seen as a source of strength. The consideration of a diverse set of problems using real data will help support this goal.

## Grading Policy
| Assignment	      | Percentage of Grade |
| :---              | :---:               |
| Homework	        | 15%                 |
| Computer Projects | 35%                 |
| Class Activities  | 10%                 |
| Midterm Exam      | 20%                 |
| Final Exam	      | 20%                 |

__Homework__ will be assigned using DataCamp. To receive credit, students need to take an assessment. These assignments will be given every two weeks. Instructions will be given on how to access these assignments in the first week of class.
* If you do not pass the assessment, then a specific 3- to 5-hour course will be assigned on that topic to learn the required skills.
* If you pass the assessment, then you will be given a more advanced course to complete to augment the skills you already have.

__Class Projects__ will be assigned for most weeks where there is not a homework assignment given. These will be opportunities for you to apply what you are learning in lecture and in the homework in a more realistic scenario.

There will be two __Class Activities__ during the semester. These will consist of competitions administered on DataCamp. You are encouraged to participate in these competitions during the semester and afterwards. They are excellent ways to practice learned skills and to pick up new skills.

The __Midterm Exam__ will be administered just before Spring Break and will cover material covered from the beginning of the semester up until that point. <!--Expect a variety of questions from multiple choice, short answer, and programming questions.-->

__The Final Exam__ will be a comprehensive exam covering material from the entire semester. <!--Expect a variety of questions from multiple choice, short answer, and programming questions.-->

>A request to take a final exam at any time other time than when it is officially scheduled must be initiated with the professor and approved by the Dean or Department Chair at least two weeks before the scheduled final exam. A charge of $50.00 per exam will be assessed if the request is approved.

### Late Policy
All __homework assignments and class projects__ will be accepted for 70% credit for one week after the due date. Homework submitted one week after the due date or later will not be accepted. __Class activities__ will not be accepted after the due date unless it is discussed with me before the due date.

>I understand that emergencies happen. As such I will wave the late penalty for up to 3 late homework assignments. Otherwise, late homework submissions need to be discussed with me prior to the due date to avoid the late penalty.

All __exams__ must be taken in the allotted time. If you cannot take the exam in the requested time, then you must *coordinate with me __no later than one week before the exam is due__*.

### Grading Scheme
| Grade	| Percentages |   | Grade | Percentages |
| :---  | :---:       |---| :---  | :---:       |
| A	    | 93% - 100%  |   | C	    | 73% - 76%   |
| A-  	| 90% - 92%   |   | C-    | 70% - 72%   |
| B+	  | 87% - 89%   |   | D     | 63% - 66%   |
| B     | 83% - 86%   |   | D-    | 60% - 62%   |
| B-	  | 80% - 82%   |   | D+    | 67% - 69%   |
| C+    | 77% - 79%   |   | F     | 0 – 59%     |

A grade of “I” (incomplete) cannot be issued unless arrangements have been made with your instructor before the last day of class. In addition, don’t expect the college to give you a “W” (withdrawal) if you disappear from school. They won’t do it. Instead, you will get a grade of “F” for the course. No exceptions. So if you must leave, please drop the course officially through the admissions and records office.
