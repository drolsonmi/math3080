    "4. Install Python directly\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, I would recommend *Google CoLab*. If you want it locally, *Anaconda* is the easiest to work with. It does install a lot of extra (non-essential) packages, but this will work quite well until we get the hang of using Python. You can always learn how to install Python directly on your computer and/or WSL later (I'm happy to show you if you would like).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to having Python on your computer, you will need a programming environment, or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).\n",
    "* Jupyter (or Python Notebooks)\n",
    "  * Simple environment which separates Python into blocks of code - only need to run one block at a time instead of the entire program\n",
    "  * Comes pre-installed in Anaconda\n",
    "  * Google CoLab uses an environment very similar to Jupyter\n",
    "* Microsoft VisualStudio Code\n",
    "  * Once you have a kernel set up, VSCode can recognize it\n",
    "  * Reads Jupyter .ipynb files\n",
    "* Spyder\n",
    "  * Nice layout for code, data displays, and figures all in one window\n",
