But as we look at the standardized and normalized data, we see that the salary of Employee 2 is very nearly in the middle (0 for Standardized, 0.5 for Normalized). So, the Salary may not be a good indicator. But looking at the Years of Experience, we see Employee 2 is actually very close to Employee 1. So, it is more likely for Employee 2 to be grouped with Employee 1."
