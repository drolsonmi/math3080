    "## Vectors\n",
    "A vector is a series of numbers that combined describe the property of something. The most common example of a vector is a point on a graph. This is used a lot in physics to describe position, velocity, forces, electric and magnetic fields, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is simply a collection of two or more points. For example, [5,2] represents a vector that points from the origin to a point 5 units to the right and 2 units up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the physical world, we generally deal with points in 3 dimensions. Our minds cannot intuitively comprehend more dimensions than that. For example, if we consider an airport to be the origin, then the vector [75,-10,6] would indicate an airplane that is 75 miles to the East, 10 miles to the South, and 6 miles up vertically."
