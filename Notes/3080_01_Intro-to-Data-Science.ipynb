    "  * Answering a question by infering information from Data\n",

    "  * Field is changing quickly\n",
    "  * Have been doing this for 1,000's of years\n",
    "  * Stages of Data Science\n",
    "    1. Gathering of Data (Collecting, curating, cleaning)\n",
    "        * Tico Bray - Astronomical observations\n",
    "    2. Analysis of Data (visualization, analysis, modeling (machine learning))\n",
    "        * Johannes Kepler - Astronomical models\n",
    "    3. Explanation of Data (Cleaning and Presenting the visuals with explanations)\n",
    "        * Isaac Newton - Laws of Motion\n",
    "        * Based his laws on the \"preponderance of the evidence\"\n",
    "  * Data Science spans all three stages, but primarily the Gathering and Analysis stages\n",
    "  * Machine learning takes up Kepler's role - come up with a general model to explain how things work\n",
    "  * Most of our work as data scientists is in the first stage - collecting and cleaning the data\n",
    "    * Bad data = Bad science\n",
    "* What is a Data Scientist?\n",
    "  * This can be difficult to answer, and the answer depends on what the person is trying to do\n",
    "      * Someone who extracts insights from messy data\n",
    "  * Most experts follow a T-shape (general knowledge of many fields, but a depth of knowledge in one field)\n",
    "  * Data scientists need to follow pi-model (depth in main field, but a second depth in data science as well)\n",
    "  * Important aspects of Data Science\n",
    "    * Reproducibility "
