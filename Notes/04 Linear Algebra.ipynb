    "## Vectors\n",
    "A vector is a series of numbers that combined describe the property of something. The most common example of a vector is a point on a graph. This is used a lot in physics to describe position, velocity, forces, electric and magnetic fields, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is simply a collection of two or more points. For example, $\\begin{pmatrix}5\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$ represents a vector that points from the origin to a point 5 units to the right and 2 units up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the physical world, we generally deal with points in 3 dimensions. Our minds cannot intuitively comprehend more dimensions than that. For example, if we consider an airport to be the origin, then the vector $\\begin{pmatrix}75\\\\-10\\\\6\\end{pmatrix}$ would indicate an airplane that is 75 miles to the East, 10 miles to the South, and 6 miles up vertically.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "x = np.array([75, -10, 6])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the data world, a vector could contain 12 pieces of information to describe a particular object. This would then be depicted as a 12-dimensional vector. The following could be a list of items that describe the background of a student:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# [height, weight, eye color, hair color, Grade in school, GPA, Housing, Pay Wage, Gender, Ethnicity, Marriage status, Religion]\n",
    "person_1 = [71, 220, 'brown', 'black', 'Sophomore', 3.78, 'Off-campus', 12.70, 'M', 'Hispanic', 'Married', 'Catholic']\n",
