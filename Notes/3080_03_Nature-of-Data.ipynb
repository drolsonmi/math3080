    "Before computers were around, statisticians were the people who would take data and infer information from it. This process of digging deep into data was called \"data dredging\", and was used as a derogatory term for the rather unpleasant task of digging deep into data. Another term used was \"data mining\". Either way, it wasn't an appealing field as the researcher had to find results based on data that wasn't there. Now, the algorithms used are much more sofisticated and more accurate. As such, it has become a popular field that we now call \"data science\".\n",

    "These courses really are the same, just looking at different aspects of Data Science. Math 3080 is going to be a review of Statistics and Math principles, then 3280 and 3480 will dig deeper. Here's how we separate these courses:\n",
    "1. In Math 3080, we will look at how to handle data, from retreiving it to cleaning and analyzing it. We will do a lot of Data Analysis work in this class.\n",
    "2. In Math 3280, we will look at challenges of having large amounts of data. We will also learn algorithms that simplifies the way we manage and work with large amounts of data.\n",

Once we find the best algorithm, we can apply it to the data in order to answer questions and use those answers to model future events.

    "In the *Mining of Massive Datasets* book by Leskovec, an example is given of something called *Bonferroni's Principle* (section 1.2.3). Assume you are searching for 2 people who you know are meeting together at hotels to plan something malicious. You decide to look for them at these hotels. Your search begins with these assumptions:\n",
    "1. There are one billion people who are suspects\n",
    "2. Everyone goes to a hotel one day in 100\n",
    "3. A hotel holds 100 people, so there are 100,000 hotels to hold the 1% of a billion people visiting a hotel on a given day\n",

    "After analyzing the probabilities and counting the number of possible times 2 people end up at the same hotel on the same night, you find that there are 250,000 positive matches. But only one is correct, so that gives 249,998 false positives (Type I error).\n",
