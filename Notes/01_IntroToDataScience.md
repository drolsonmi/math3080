## What does it take to be a data scientist
A data scientist should be:
* naturally curious
* storytellers
* able to be self-taught

Skills needed for a data scientist (in order)
1. Passionate about some field 
    * DS for the sake of DS is generally not helpful - you need something to apply it to
    * Many of the team leads are PhD's (in physics or )
2. Social skills
    * Working in teams
3. Sense of humor
4. Math knowledge
    * algebra, geometry, calculus, basic statistics for DA
    * more statistics and linear algebra for DS
5. Technical skills
    * computational thinking
    * some skills can be learned later, but there should at least be a background
