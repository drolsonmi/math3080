# Math 3080 Course Schedule - Spring 2023
These are the topics that we plan to cover this semester:
* What is Data?
* Basic Python
* Linear Algebra Review
* Statistics Review
* Obtaining Data
* Graphing Data
* Cleaning Data
* Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
* Machine Learning basics (we will cover as many as we have time for)
  * k-Nearest Neighbors
  * Naive Bayes
  * Decision Trees
  * Neural Networks

Following is my planned schedule for the course. It is incomplete at this point, but will be changed as the semester progresses. The textbooks and videos are found on the [Textbooks](https://github.com/drolsonmi/math3080/blob/main/3080_Textbooks.md) page.
